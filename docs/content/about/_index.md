# What is pico-go?

pigo-go is a standalone (offline) gamedev tool using Go.  It is for developing simple games / demos like the [pico8 console](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) but instead of coding in Lua you use Go.

# Why did I build it?

I spend quite a while sitting on trains to and from work and during my commute I normally entertain myself by tinkering away at code.

Ever since I was young I've enjoyed developing games and graphical demos.  I cut my teeth coding on ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64 many moons ago and got the mug.  I was a very small part of the demoscene and that love of developing that kind of code never died.

I have developed and abandon too many projects to list. Often they start small and beautiful and then my ambitions get carried away and the balloon into something too large.  Real-life then catches up with me and I get distracted, never to return again.

Then a few years ago I discovered the pico8 fantasy console.
